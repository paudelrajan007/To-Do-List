# ✅ Persistent CLI To-Do List App

A simple and beginner-friendly command-line To-Do List application built using Python.
This app allows you to **add**, **view**, and **delete** tasks directly in the terminal,
and all tasks are saved in a file (`task.txt`) so they remain even after you close the program.

This task is created for the **Python Developer Internship** as part of Task 2.
